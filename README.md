You've stumbled upon my humble GitHub README! I'm Jack, and I love working on small coding projects, like Panini, a SMS bot I made that sends cute messages.

I'm also interested in more mathematically involved projects, like ML for example. I enjoy solving small puzzles that add up to a greater whole,
and I'm passionate about coding in education, pedagogy, and the schooling system.

Want to work on a project? Shoot me an email! jackowenmoody [at] gmail [dot] com.
